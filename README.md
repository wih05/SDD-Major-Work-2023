# SDD-Major-Work-2023
This will be a repository for the development of my SDD major work over the course of the year.
The modules that will need to be included for this program to run is pygame.
This program will only work on Windows as i am using the os module on Windows

To run the program just open up the Main_Game.py to start the program.
