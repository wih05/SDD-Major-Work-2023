# SDD-Major-Work-2023
This is the repository used for the development of my SDD Major Project over the coarse of 8 months,
currently this project is finished, however i might add extra things later on, however that is not certain.
The modules that will need to be included for this program to run is pygame.
This program will only work on Windows as i am using the os module on Windows

To run the program just open up the Main_Menu.py to start the program.
